# EnvoyCharts
Small data tracking/charting tool for envoy IQ solar systems

# Two commands
* envoy-poll -- runs and queries the envoy every 10 minutes for current production/consumption data
* envoy-chart -- updates the bar.html file with the current chart

# Still a work-in-progress
I'm just getting started. This is not ready for use. It is functional, but will need a lot of work to be useful.
